minor_changes:
  - >
    ``foundata.acmesh.run`` - Added automatic hook and reload command configuration
    updates for existing certificates. The role now detects when hook configurations
    (pre_hook, post_hook, renew_hook, reloadcmd) have changed in Ansible variables and
    automatically updates the corresponding base64-encoded values in acme.sh certificate
    config files without requiring certificate re-issuance. This is a workaround for
    upstream issue https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh/issues/3936.
  - >
    ``foundata.acmesh.run`` - Added Molecule verification tests to ensure hook
    configuration updates work correctly and validate the proper base64 encoding of hook
    commands in certificate config files.
