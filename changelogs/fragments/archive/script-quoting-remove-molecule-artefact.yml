minor_changes:
  - Exclude ``extensions/molecule`` from build artifacts. This reduces the size of the resulting artifact. The Ansible Molecule directory is intended for developer testing and not needed in production artifacts, where environment-specific testing can be performed independently.
  - Improved inline script quoting. Ensure safer handling of input by adding ``ansible.builtin.quote`` where appropriate. Even if inputs are user-controlled or derived from internal variables, it's better to be safe and prevent potential issues with shell parsing.
