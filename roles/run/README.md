## Role variables<a id="variables"></a>

See [`defaults/main.yml`](./defaults/main.yml) for all available role parameters and their description. [`vars/main.yml`](./vars/main.yml) contains internal variables you should not override (but their description might be interesting).

Additionally, there are variables read from other roles and/or the global scope (for example, host or group vars) as follows:

- None right now.



## Example playbooks, using this role<a id="examples"></a>

```yaml
---

- name: "Initialize the foundata.acmesh.run role"
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:

    - name: "Trigger invocation of the foundata.acmesh.run role"
      ansible.builtin.include_role:
        name: "foundata.acmesh.run"
      vars:
        run_acmesh_autoupgrade: true
```


## Supported tags<a id="tags"></a>

It might be useful and faster to only call parts of the role by using tags:

- `run_acmesh_setup`: Manage basic resources, such as packages or service users.
- `run_acmesh_config`: Manage settings, such as adapting or creating configuration files.
There are also tags usually not meant to be called directly but listed for the sake of completeness** and edge cases:

- `run_acmesh_always`, `always`: Tasks needed by the role itself for internal role setup and the Ansible environment.



## Dependencies<a id="dependencies"></a>

See `dependencies` in [`meta/main.yml`](./meta/main.yml).



## Compatibility<a id="compatibility"></a>

See `min_ansible_version` in [`meta/main.yml`](./meta/main.yml) and `__run_acmesh_supported_platforms` in [`vars/main.yml`](./vars/main.yml).



## External requirements<a id="requirements"></a>

There are no special requirements not covered by Ansible itself.
