minor_changes:
  - "``foundata.acmesh.run`` - Added automatic hook and reload command configuration updates for existing certificates. The role now detects when hook configurations (pre_hook, post_hook, renew_hook, reloadcmd) have changed in Ansible variables and automatically updates the corresponding base64-encoded values in acme.sh certificate config files without requiring certificate re-issuance. This is a workaround for upstream issue https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh/issues/3936."
  - "``foundata.acmesh.run`` - Added Molecule verification tests to ensure hook configuration updates work correctly and validate the proper base64 encoding of hook commands in certificate config files."
